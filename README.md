# Analysis of top Spotify Tracks of 2018
Description: The purpose of this project is to, through the use of machine learning algorithms and regression-based models, determine what aspects of a song make it 'good', the ideal song qualities as well as what two attributes had the strongest relationship. The results concluded that the most impactful quality of a song was its energy level and the two attributes with the strongest relationship was energy and loudness.

Dataset: The dataset  ‘top2018.csv’ used for this project was obtained from the online source Kaggle. The data was collected in 2018 with the use of the Spotify Web API and Spotify Python library which allowed for extraction of features for each song. The applicable license for the data files is Data files © Original Authors.

Installation and execution: This project contains two code files, one rmd R code file and a python file. To be executed, both files need to be downloaded along with the dataset and put into the same workspace in R and using a software to run python (ex. Google colab).

This project was completed by myself, Lakshmi Pattathe a third year Data Science student.
